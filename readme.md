Hello!

I have created this blog project using laravel5.6.

I have used Laravel authentication package **php artisan make:auth** for authentication or login/registration purpose.
This blog system have basic privacy features.
- A guest user can only view users posts and can't react on them.
- User can edit/delete only own posts.
- An admin user can view and update all users.

- Dashboard button is only accessible by admin.
- To run this project in this current state, you need to enter categories in your database.

I'll improve this with passage of time.


If you have any query, contact me.
Thanks
